Java Past, present, and future

April 23, 2014

The constraints of evolving a mature and popular language are much different from those when designing something new


What's new in Java 8?

- lambdas
- more type inference
- default and static methods in interfaces
- java.util.stream package for aggregate / data-parallel operations
  - Must check this out

"when code looks more like a problem description, it's more likely to be correct"

Brian says to check out guy steele's strangeloop talk on parallelism from 3 years ago. one of best talks he's ever seen and an inspiration for java 8's parallel goodies

This stream business looks friggin amazing!

collection.stream()...
collection.parallelStream()...

This offers functional idioms without being too pushy.

"if you want people to do the right thing, make the path of least resistance lead to the right thing, and then people's natural laziness will do the work for you"
