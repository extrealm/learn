Power of an Agile Mindset

This talk is about much more than software

Finished her phd in CS 1 month before her 50th birthday. 

1. If it has to do with agility, and how your brain works, don't let anybody ever tell you that you're too old, or too young, or too anything to do whatever is is that you want to do... if you're willing to invest the energy that it's going to take

- she says: look to her as a role model for this attitude


OMG... she's hysterical.

She asks how many of us are using agile, and why we decided to. Did we read all the longitudinal, controlled studies in the literature demonstrating its efficacy? No... because they don't exist

Draws a comparison to drug companies... "we have little pharmacies in our heads" when talking about placebo

Is agile a placebo, that it works because we believe in it?

Talks about "fixed" vs "effort" mindsets, using an example with students

This is the example of choosing an easy/difficult test (puzzle in the example in "Drive")

Phase 1: take an easy test

Phase 2: choice between an easy and difficult test

The group that believes in effort likes challenge / embraces the chance to fail but the opportunity to learn

The group with the fixed mindset seeks the easy way so that they look good. It shows everybody, including myself, that "I have it", be it talent, intelligence, etc

Phase 3 of the study then gave all students a difficult test and asked them to talk to themselves, out loud

The effort group coached and encouraged themselves

The fixed group were easily discouraged. negative self talk

Phase 4 of the study allowed the students to choose between looking at the exams of those who did better, or those who did worse

Phase 5 of the study, all students given easy test, similar to phase 1

Effort students improved, fixed students were slightly worse

Thus, the challenge of the difficult test had a negative effect on their performance on another easy test. Almost a self fulfilling test, where they started to get discouraged, and the negative voice in the head led to the performance decrease that they were worrying about.

Phase 6, all students asked to give advice to other students and include their scores

Effort students, lots of advice and encouragement

Fixed students, little or no advice, and ~40% lied about their scores

## Sources

This study is described in "Mindset" by carol dweck

- See Po Bronson "How not to talk to your kids" in new york magazine

- Time magazine "How to help them succeed"

- "The talent myth", gladwell.com, and the New Yorker


## The Two Mindsets: Fixed vs Agile


- Ability: static, like height, vs can grow, like muscle
- Goal: look good vs learn
- Challenge: avoid vs embrace
- Failure: defines your identity vs provides information
- Effort: for those with no talent vs path to mastery
- Reaction to challenge: helplessness vs resilience

## What you believe about yourself affects belief about others

- fixed mindset are quick to judge others based on little information and quick to stereotype
- agile mindset don't ignore information but are less negative / positive

## Why are women not entering IT, or dropping out?

What are we saying to bright little girls?

One danger: calling them smart, talented, pretty, etc constantly in an effort to build up self esteem

- the research is clear: "bright little girls" are the most fixed-mindset of all. 

why? They want to be perfect and live up to those expectations. And in grade school, they can often pull it off, but as they get to junior high it starts to get a lot more challenging

## What about bright little boys?


## Companies can have a mindset

Tells about Enron

 - identify and hire "the best talent"
 - and continuously and ruthlessly grade, sort, fire, and promote: "rank and yank"
 - so it becomes a game of always looking good and making others look bad

On the other extreme, she talks about Southwest

She says that the b-school studies on how southwest operates shows the company "screams agile mindset"
 
- Hire for The "Southwest Attitude": learning, growing, being open, trust

- Treat people not like people with a fixed ability to be measured and ranked, but as people with an ability to grow

## Managers have mindsets

"Pygmalion in Management", J. Sterling Livingston, Oct 1988 Harvard Business Review

  - your attitude toward your employees will determine how they perform
  - managers make up their minds on how an employee will perform long before they've had a chance to evaluate performance
  - expectations determine outcomes

 - same goes for how we treat our teammates!
 - thus, it's up to us to grow each other, and ourselves. What are you telling yourself, and what are you telling others, about your believe in our/their abilities



## Teams have mindsets

 - teams not willing to talk about their problems, who treat problems as bad, do not have an agile mindset
 - If it's "meant to be" then it must be perfect... BS. even great relationships still have problems 
 - reality: there are no perfect relationships or people 

## Education and failure

 - we are balanced toward a fixed mindset in that all the problems are solvable
 - we'd do well to teach people how to fail more effectively

## Good news

- Mindset is not fixed
- we can encourage one of the other mindset in each other
- even small manipulations can move mindsets

- She goes back to the experiment from the beginning

- To the effort group, after the first teset, they returned the test and said "here's your test. You did really well. you must have worked hard"
- To the smart group, after the first test, they said "you did really well. you must be really smart"

She says: Praise effort, not talent, in your children

- Praise strategies, process
- don't ignore failures... teach that it's a way to learn and improve

- even be direct: Which mindset do you want to hold? Even the process of examining mindset can help shift mindset


## So what about the kids told "You're stupid"

- This produces a different kind of fixed mindset: "I'll never be able to do anything / be anything", etc
- This is what Carol Dweck is now researching, and to try to teach these kids an agile mindset

- kid says "You mean I don't have to be stupid?"

## For Kids

- "that was a clever approach", "I'm proud of your persistence"
- "practice is really making you better"
- "Did you give your best effort?"
- Instead of "how was your day", ask "What did you learn today?"

.. and others... go find her slides!

## For Adults

- When people are down on themselves, don't encourage them with "you're smart". Instead,remind them of times when determination and hard work led to success. Don't label! Call up the determination instead

## For yourself

  - go see her slides
