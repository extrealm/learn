# Mandi Walls, Organizational Pathologies

- Got here 25 minutes late

- Book: Typology of Organisational Cultures


- Problem with DevOps teams: doesn't communicate that DevOps is everyone's job
  - this is probably in the same kind of org where security isn't everyone's job, performance isn't everyone's job, etc

- Leads me to ask a question of our own team: What are we doing to make it such that DevOps is everyone's job? Anything? Actively discouraging that?

## Breaking through bureaucracy

- it's about people: put faces to tasks and processes
- overshare: no such thing as TMI

# Generative Organizations

- Performance oriented
  - individuals bought in to mission
  - free flow of information (wikis, brown bags, bulletin boards, etc)
  - shared risks and responsibilities
  - trust, alignment, empowerment
- high cooperations
- messengers trained
- risks shared
- bridging encouraged

- DevOps is just the way we work; automation, metrics, sharing
- new projects inherit devops dna right from the start
- sharing is common and celebrated

- generative organizations are "globally safe" (as opposed to locally)
- blameless post-mortems
  - about things other than just service disruptions; someone leaves, eg
- open experimentation

## Getting to generative

- build trust
- communicate
- share knowledge, lessons. Be proactive in sharing
- embrace and build from failure
- be clear on goals, empower people
- reward the behaviors that reflect your values
