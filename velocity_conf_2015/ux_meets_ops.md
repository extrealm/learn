# Tim Sheiner, Jut, Where UX Meets Ops

He's wearing a beret.

## Personas

- trying to be very explicit about who we're designing for
- helps build empathy and connection with that user, to help build mental models

### DevOps Personas

1. the architect
  - how do I increase the capacity and resilience of this system. thinking about the future
1. ops guy
  - how do I keep this thing running?
1. developer
  - build features that deliver value

They're all oriented about "the system", but what is that system?

**Mental models**

- help us understand the world
- we observe things in the world, and they suggest models to us
- this guides our actions
- we communicate by telling stories about our models

- asking someone to "describe the system" isn't helpful
- instead, "tell me a story about what's challenging with the system", eg
  - "tell me what happens when you get an alert"
- Analogies can help bridge the gap between researcher and subject
  - helps the researcher validate understanding of what the subject is trying to say

**Analogies**

- way to validate congruence in mental models
- method to bring past experience to bear on present circumstances
- often helps you realize a solution in a different context can be applied to this one

**Prototypes**

- every prototype has a specific learning objective
- prototypes are cheap visual experiments
- they move the conversation forward
- prototypes improve communication; produce a shared reference for communication
