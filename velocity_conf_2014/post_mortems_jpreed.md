Post mortems

J. Paul Reed, The Ship Show

- Clip from stressful situation between pilot and air traffic controller

- This is all about Dekker's work (new view vs old view)


Hindsight bias

  "we should have known"

  "why didn't you notice...."

  These are counterfactuals


  "outcome bias"
    - "ugly stepsister of hindsight bias"
    - when things kinda sorta work out, and you say "well, maybe it's OK" and you keep pushing the system's boundaries
    - example of the sketchy airplane landings

  " correspondence bias" -- fundamental attribution error
    - putting undue emphasis on someone else's error (I need to research this more)


Common false assumptions

 - see his slide

## Bad apples

 - assume nobody comes to work to do a bad job
 - but we really, really think it's "human error" (we keep having postmortems because of joe)
 - reprimanding bad apples is like peeing your pants: initial relief, but you look like a fool
 - Because there's something else going on that keeps causing joe to fail, or the org to enable failure


# Systemic model

## Debrief the actors

  - you can tell a lot about an org by how interested people are in the post mortems

- difference between accountability and responsibility

- everyone should be accountable, and should account for what they did. That doesn't mean they're responsible

## Create a timeline

 - Look into ChatOps for recording stuff that goes on
 - a timeline is critical


## findings of fact vs judgment

- you can have a discussion without judgment

- From context to concept
  - you're going to try to recreate reality and draw conclusions from it
  - but you really have to look at the facts from multiple perspectives
  - successive approximations... don't jump at the first conclusion

## Remediation

- Recommendations are predictions
- remediation should be considered an experiment: probe, sense, respond

- you don't actually know that the recommendations will solve the problem or prevent another problem

- recommendations should be SMART (specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic, time bounded)

- you need them to be timebound b/c you want to measure them at some point... "did this work?"

## Morgue

github.com/etsy/morgue

- a post-mortem keeper
- enables you to analyze your post mortems to see if you're getting better at them


## So now what?

- you learn a lot about the system and the org... that's the value
- it might not feel satisfying at first
- you will want to ask "Whos' responsible, what's the root cause?" but that's not going to help you learn
