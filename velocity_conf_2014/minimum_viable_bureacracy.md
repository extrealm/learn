"your approach scales until it doesn't"

team/company size is the same... things scale linearly, then blow up, then you rearchitect


Dunbar's number: cognitive limit on the number of people with whom you can maintain relationships; theoretically between 150 and 230

- science behind this sucks, but it is intuitive that it's hard to have lots more relationships than that


"Chaord, trust, and autonomy"

Chaord, Dee Hock

"any self-organizing adaptive nonlinear complex system whether physical, biological, or social, the behavior of which exhibits characteristics of both order and chaos"

John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, described mozilla as chaordic

- high degree of chaos, high degree of order, robust, failure tolerant, creative

many open source projects are like this. Some companies are, too

traditional management: get your ducks in a row

Chaordic management: self-organizing ducks


Trust is The basis of any self-organizing system

"Nobody comes to work to do a bad job" -- Sidney Dekker

How to build trust?

- time: many small deposits in the trust bank
- start by trusting others
- be trustworthy
- build relationships outside of tense environments
- if you're only interacting with people when everything is on fire, you can't build a trust relationships

- this puts pressure on hiring: "Can I trust this person to do a good job?" If no, don't hire them

Trust enables autonomy

autonomy enables engineer happiness

autonomy enables leadership to scale


- Awesome communication practices... require practice
- overcommunicate
- effective remote teams are good at this
- write/record more things
- **asyncrony is key**

- when you do have water cooler conversations, record those, too: "I was in the office, and I talked to so and so, and blah blah"

- Remote teams enable hiring the best people

- good communication practices + high levels of trust = remote effectiveness

- use an issue tracker and record everything!


- team meetings can actually reduce communication
- waiting for a weekly team meeting is like waiting for an annual perf review
- Shoot for frequent, explicit feedback.

- replace the idea of a meeting with a conversation instead %s/meeting/conversation/g
- if you're invited to a meeting and you're not going to talk, don't go


- Minimum viable documentation

 - how to install, create, and ship a change
 - roadmap
 - changelog
 - glossary
 - where to get help

 - AKA apply an open source model

 - subject matter experts emerge
 - make sure they have seconds... don't let those experts be a single person of failure
 - rotate unwanted responsibilities (and if everybody hates it, figure out how to get rid of it or improve it)

 - at mozilla, a SME = module owner = BDFL; seconds = peers = committers

 - **remember**: self-organizing does not equal democracy, and it doesn't equal anarchy


- Architectural problems as bikesheds

 - many arch. problems are bikesheds... everyone has an opinion
 - let the primary owner or motivated champion time to build a prototype
 - don't let it fester too long go

proof of concept + momentum == gets people motivated, makes the path clear

"come with code". many of the hardest problems and rewrites are 80% done by one person in a 2 day marathon (then, of course, comes the other 80%)

- a portion of each engineer's time must be spent on what that engineer thinks is most important.

  - it might be 100%, 60, 40, 20... but it should never be 0%


# Checkpoint:

 - push responsibility to the edges
 - follow open source models
 - give people freedom to innovate


# Non bikesheds

 - brainstorm the interfaces, split up and go
 - interface design + decoupling far more critical than component design
 - works very well with a remote team
 - you want things to be decoupled and replaceable

# operational problem solving

 - evidence > gut feelings
 - operational mindset is a key skill for developers. this is "empathy for ops".
   - she says this is the most important skill a dev can have

# iteration

 - minimum viable product applies to everything
 - iterate, iterate, iterate
 - estimation is top-down, but chaordic orgs are bottom up

 - anti-estimation: prototype, set timeboxes, build the hardest part first, iterate toward greatness
 - don't commit to estimates for unknown tasks

# never-done-ness

  - fight micro-perfectionism
  - aim for micro-quality
  - good code with tests in each iteration
  - iterate to better quality

  - "100% perfectionists never ship, 100% pragmatists ship shit"

# fix it now

  - if something isn't working, fix it. not "some day". Now.
  - change one thing at a time.
  - empower people to fix broken things

# why managers at all?

 - there is no such thing as a flat organization
 - structure may be emergent, but it's there
 - leaders guide emergent culture and structure in a constructive direction
 - leaders and community rules emerge constructively or destructively: think, web forums

 - what do managers do?

   - recruit
   - support, transmit, guide culture
   - mentorship
   - prioritization
   - big picture
   - do things no one else wants to do

## Servant leadership model

  - be humble
  - be an enabler
  - enabling is more important than doing, but she says don't stop coding
  - introverts make great servant leaders

  - she lists the 10 traits of a servant leader... See slide 66 at https://speakerdeck.com/lauraxt/minimum-viable-bureaucracy-june-2014-edition

## Marketing / visibility

  - this is a good team to join
  - this is a good team to work on my stuff
  - this team makes things I want to use
  - you must be visible as an awesome team
  - this raises morale, builds culture


# Ask questions

 - as opposed to dictating all the things
 - help people figure things out on their own
 - socratic method
 - builds people, knowledge, confidence


# Stumbles

 - first, no surprises
 - shorten feedback cycle time
   - as soon as someone starts to suck, tell them
 - every reason and person is different
 - help them fix it, or help them find somewhere else they will be happier

# takeaways

 - mastery
 - autonomy
 - purpose
