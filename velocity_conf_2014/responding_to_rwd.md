# Responding to RWD â€“ A Case Study of Managing Change within the Enterprise

Nicole Harris (Nationwide), Brian

Nationwide is a fortune 100 company.... insurance, banking, dozen other brands

Large org, old, established, siloed, tons of IT applications owned by different IT organizations that don't actually talk to each other

This is how they introduced responsive web design into this complicated scenario

## How to go responsive when people are afraid of change

The business came to them asking for a mobile solution.

they didn't know what they needed

But they had one stipulation: you can't touch the desktop

- The idea of change is scarier than the change itself
- so they had to explain to people what responsive was
  - this meant showing the business what it meant
  - they brought in IT very early on, which was not the norm at nationwide

Why responsive?

 - app or m.dot vs. RWD
 - multiple code bases

 - responsive was the best way for them to use existing skills, didn't require much on the backend, didn't require multiple codebases or new technologies

Estimates and Timelines

 - no prior experience
 - fear of delivery timelines and funding
 - level setting expectations

Generating excitement

  - putting devices in people's hands
  - took those devices to user testing sessions, too
