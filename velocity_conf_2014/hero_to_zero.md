# From Hero to Zero

Jennifer Davis (Chef) @sigje

She describes how she became a hero, and the amount of work it involved

"How do I get people to work like me?"

But she realized: She was wrong

She had come to a point where she was the expert, she was the SPOF, and she was alone

## Hero

in the workplace, it can mean:

 - gone the extra mile
 - worked really late solving something
 - spent all weekend
 - virtue of the quality of brain numbing work

**Results in**

 - degradation in relationships
 - sleep deprivation
 - degradation of productivity and creativity
 - degradation in mental acuity
 - loss of empathy
 - job dissatisfaction
 - loss of self confidence


 "All of this crap is bad"... so why would we want to associate this with heroism?

- It's very important to mentor people on this stuff!
- Junior people coming in need to know that heroism is a bad thing


Describes the "Exhaustion Funnel", Marie Asberg, Karolinska Institute -- see her slides


Crunch time is the most expensive way to work. Performance degrades, and recovery time is slow, too

Celebrate being wrong

 - it's human, no need for humiliation
 - de-escalation of all our holy wars (this tool vs that)
 - freedom to experiment
 - shared experiences over checklists

Rites of passage -- Junior to senior

 - ability to listen
 - freedom to speak
 - ok to be junior!
 - creation of open and transparent environments
 - encourage everyone to have a voice



5 conditions of happy work environment:

- freedom
- challenge,
- education
- positive atmosphere
- personally meaningful contribution


How to move away from hero culture

- Communication -- Identify your team
  - your team is everyone with a common goal
  - includes all the different roles
  - diversity of views
  - same objective

- Identify your state

  - explicit vision/mission statement
  - vision statement provides direction and enables cohesion

- You need to visualize your work

  - method of tracking work
  - communicates status
  - measures progress: if you're not measuring, how do you know if you're succeeding?
  - identified boundaries

- Infrastructure as code

  - this is one huge way to prepare for the Bus

- Documentation as code

 - look up Evan Goer's talk on youtube

- Local development

  - vagrant, etc
