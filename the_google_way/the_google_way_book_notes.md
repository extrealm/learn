# My approach to reading this book

# Thesis

If I were to write a thesis statement for this book, like we all learned in high school, it is something like:

"2 brilliant math-addicted nerds start a new company that succeeds by being constantly contrary and disregarding conventional wisdom, leveraging proximity to and relationships with the academic community, hiring A++ engineers who value reputation above all else, using reputation and social pressure instead of deeply hierarchical management to motivate engineers, and building a triumvirate at the top that led to more effective decision making."


## Disregarding conventional wisdom

## Relationships with academia

## Culture of Engineering Reputation

## 20% Time

## Small teams

## Promotions

## Intranet and culture of sharing

## Measure everything

## Preserving reputation

## Fragmentation
